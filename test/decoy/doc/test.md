### Go Filer Version 2: Test Documentation for Port 6969

---

## Introduction

This document provides details on the test case implemented for Go Filer Version 2 to verify that port 6969 is not open. The test ensures that the port is unreachable, which helps in validating that no unintended services are running on this port.

## Test Case

### Test Case: Check if Port 6969 is Unreachable

**Objective**: Verify that port 6969 on localhost is not open or listening for connections.

**Test File**: `port_6969_test.go`

**Test Function**: `TestPort6969Unreachable`

**Description**: This test checks that port 6969 on localhost is unreachable. This ensures that no other application or service is running on this port, which should remain closed for our use case.

**Steps**:
1. Attempt to establish a TCP connection to `localhost:6969`.
2. Use a 2-second timeout for the connection attempt.
3. If the connection fails (which is expected), log the success and pass the test.
4. If the connection is successful, close it and fail the test.

## Conclusion

This test case verifies that port 6969 on localhost is not open, ensuring that no unintended applications are using this port. This helps validate the network setup and prevents potential conflicts with other services. Future tests can expand on this foundation to cover more functionality and edge cases.
